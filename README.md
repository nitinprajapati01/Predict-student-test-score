## Predict-student-test-score
This project aims to create a predictive model for student test scores using IBM SPSS Modeler and Python. The dataset used for this project contains information on students' demographics, academic background, and other relevant factors that may affect their test scores.

## IBM SPSS Moduler
We have used four different machine learning algorithms in this project: linear regression, neural network, XGBoost, and random forest. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and each algorithm was trained on the training set and tested on the testing set.

After comparing the performance of the four algorithms, we found that linear regression achieved the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of 95%. The other algorithms also performed well, with neural network achieving an accuracy of 92%, XGBoost achieving an accuracy of 93%, and random forest achieving an accuracy of 94%.
